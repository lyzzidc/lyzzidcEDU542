Canvas by Instructure is a robust learning management system (LMS) offering tools for course creation, content management, assessment, grading, and communication. Research shows Canvas enhances student engagement and learning outcomes through interactive features like discussion boards, multimedia integration, and real-time feedback ([APST 2.6](APST%202.md#^6df62f)) (Dahlstrom et al., 2014; Brown et al., 2017).  However, new users may find its extensive features overwhelming, requiring significant training (Turnbull et al., 2019). Despite this, Canvas remains a highly effective LMS that enhances teaching practices and student learning experiences.
