The K'gari interactive documentary provides an in-depth exploration of K'gari (Fraser Island), blending multimedia storytelling with interactive elements to immerse users in the island's rich history, culture, and environment. This digital resource effectively combines high-quality visuals ([APST 1.1](APST%201.md#^1f356e)), historical narratives, and indigenous perspectives, offering a comprehensive understanding of K'gari's significance. Research supports the documentary's educational value, highlighting its ability to engage learners through interactive features that promote active participation and deeper comprehension (Pâquet, 2020). However, a critique reveals that while the documentary excels in providing an immersive experience, it may require supplementary resources for a more detailed academic study, as interactive elements sometimes prioritize engagement over exhaustive content depth. Overall, the K'gari interactive documentary is a valuable tool for educators, facilitating a broad and deep understanding of K'gari, supported by a well-rounded multimedia approach.
