Using Google Forms, teachers can design various custom questions, including multiple choice, short answers, and essay questions. Additionally, videos and photos can be incorporated into the questions or used as supplementary material.

This tool provides critical feedback on student learning, which is integrated into reporting ([APST 5.5](APST%205.md#^abf7d0)) and used to refine lessons. It supports [APST 5](APST%205.md) by enabling the monitoring of learning ([APST 5.4](APST%205.md#^53c72e)) through exit tickets, understanding checks ([APST 5.1](APST%205.md#^5caf79)), and feedback.

Google Forms enhances student engagement ([APST 1.6](APST%201.md#^1de1ba)) and participation while providing immediate feedback ([APST 5.2](APST%205.md#^aa5cb5)). Students can clarify their understanding, and teachers can adjust their instruction based on responses  ([APST 3.6](APST%203.md#^b7ebf8)) (*Nguyen et al.,* 2018).
