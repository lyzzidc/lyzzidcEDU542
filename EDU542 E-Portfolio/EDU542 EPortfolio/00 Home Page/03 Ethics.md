The Australian Curriculum highlights the significance of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in enabling students to assess, create, express their ideas, solve problems, and collaborate with others (*The Australian Curriculum*, 2018). However, ethical considerations are essential to protect students from harm when using ICT (*Department of Education Victoria*, 2023; *Department of Education NSW*, 2024). Teachers have a duty of care to ensure the safe and appropriate use of ICT in the classroom and must be vigilant to avoid presenting misleading, false, or dangerous content (*Shin*, 2015). Some states, such as Victoria, have policies related to the responsible use of ICT, including cyber safety (*Department of Education Victoria*, 2023; *Department of Education, NSW*, 2024). Ethical considerations encompass privacy and safety (data collection and usage), protection from malicious websites, online security (including discrimination), cyberbullying, and misinformation.

For Christian educators, ICT tools support students' learning while encouraging them to use these tools for the benefit of others. From a Christian perspective, each person is made in the likeness of God and has the capacity to create and perform good deeds. However, sin distorts our hearts, leading people to prioritize their own interests over others, including God. As a result, certain technologies can promote self-interest and the pursuit of power (*Parker*, 2017). Christian faith addresses not only the content and purpose of teaching and learning but also the method of demonstrating and practicing the Good News (*Smith*, 2018).
