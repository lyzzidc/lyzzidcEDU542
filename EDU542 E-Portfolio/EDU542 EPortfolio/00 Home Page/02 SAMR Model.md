The SAMR model, developed by Dr. Ruben Puentedura, (Puentedura, 2014) is a framework for integrating technology into teaching and learning. It consists of four levels: Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, and Redefinition. At the Substitution level, technology acts as a direct substitute for traditional tools, with no functional change. Augmentation also substitutes but with added functionalities. Modification involves significant task redesign through technology, enhancing student engagement and learning outcomes. Redefinition, the highest level, enables the creation of new, previously inconceivable tasks, fundamentally transforming learning experiences. The SAMR model helps educators evaluate and enhance the use of technology in their instructional practices. (Puentedura, 2014, 2014; Romrell et al., 2014)
