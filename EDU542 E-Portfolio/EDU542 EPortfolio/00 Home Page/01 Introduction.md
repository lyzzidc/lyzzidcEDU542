This portfolio includes a collection of digital resources suitable for use in educational settings. There are [ten resources](04%20APST%20ICT%20Resource%20Links.md) highlighted in this portfolio. Each ICT tool will be evaluated based on its relevance to the first five graduate standards of the [Australian Professional Standards for Teachers (APST)](https://www.aitsl.edu.au/standards) (*Australian Professional Standards for Teachers*, n.d.) Additionally, each digital resource will be assessed using the [SAMR](02%20SAMR%20Model.md) (Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, and Redefinition) framework, along with ethical considerations (Hamilton et al., 2016).

Many of the resources could be integrated in a variety classrooms across the curriculum, but I have found them particularly useful in teaching the following [NESA](https://www.educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/portal/nesa/home) (*NSW Education Standards,* n.d.) subjects:
Commerce (Stage 5)
Economics (Stage 6)
Business Studies (Stage 6)
History and Geography (Stages 4 & 5)

Research indicates that employing a variety of ICT resources improves teaching by providing more engaging materials to clarify concepts and illustrate examples (Killen & O'Toole, 2022).
