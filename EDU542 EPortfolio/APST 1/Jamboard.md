The first obvious negative is Google is phasing out Jamboard, after October 2024 it will be 'view only'. 

Jamboard facilitates live collaboration via an interactive whiteboard where students can write, draw, sketch, or add images ([APST 1.5](APST%201.md#^9d835b)). It serves as a creative tool for brainstorming, reviewing prior knowledge, and revising ideas. 

Google Jamboard supports comprehensive strategies across the APST in teaching, learning, assessing, and reporting through its collaborative digital whiteboard features. Educators can utilize Jamboard to facilitate interactive lessons ([APST 3.5](APST%203.md#^2c230c)) by integrating multimedia and fostering student engagement ([APST 2.1](APST%202.md#^eac118)). It enables formative assessment ([APST 5.1](APST%205.md#^5caf79)) through real-time feedback and collaborative activities, while also enhancing reporting ([APST 2.3](APST%202.md#^6c4ae0)) by capturing and sharing visual learning artifacts to communicate student progress effectively with stakeholders ([APST 5.5](APST%205.md#^abf7d0)).
