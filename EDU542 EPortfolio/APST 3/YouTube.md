Research has indicated that leveraging YouTube effectively can contribute to students' cognitive advancement (Kibirige & Odora, 2021). YouTube serves as a versatile platform for learning, offering accessible educational content across diverse subjects through engaging videos and visual demonstrations. While it enhances comprehension and engagement, its open nature poses challenges like misinformation and distractions, necessitating critical evaluation of content. Nevertheless, YouTube's global accessibility and diverse perspectives enrich learning opportunities, making it a valuable educational resource when used judiciously.
